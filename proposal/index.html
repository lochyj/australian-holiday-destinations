                    About Our Project
                </h1>

                <h4>What is your chosen topic and why is this a topic you wish to research?</h4>
                <p>Website Topic: Holiday destinations of Australians.<br>
                We chose this topic as it has potential for interesting charts and graphics to put on the website and will provide insight into the many aspects of why people travel to different destinations. Additionally, we can get data from a variety of Australians as we can survey the diverse culture of students (Primary data) and find data on other groups, particularly of different ages, from trustworthy sources online (Secondary data).</p>
                <br>

                <h4>Purpose of the website - Persuade, Inform or Entertain? What does it aim to achieve?</h4>
                <p>The purpose of the website is to inform readers of the factors that influence Australians to visit different destinations during the holiday. In addition, this information may persuade readers of the site to visit particular destinations if they have similar reasons for travel as those who have been surveyed.</p>
                <br>
    
                <h4>Intended audience - Describe the type of students this website is targeted towards and why, eg age group, ethnicity, gender, interests, etc</h4>
                <p>Our intended audience are Australians of any ethnicity and any gender looking for somewhere to go during the holidays or reasons they should visit particular places. The website will be aimed towards people aged 15-55 (teenagers/young adults/parents). This is because these statistics are the most relevant towards this demographic, meaning it can help them make a decision in regards to vacation destinations.</p>
                <br>
    
                <h4>What information based on primary data are you aiming to collect and present on your website?</h4>
                <p>We plan on sending surveys to students (aged 15-18) that ask them about recent holiday destinations, how frequently they travel, their ethnicity and factors that may have influenced them to travel there. We will then present this data to highlight the most common holiday locations and the factors that influence holiday destinations.</p>
                <br>

                <h4>What information based on secondary data are you aiming to research and present on your website?</h4>
                <p>We plan on finding surveys and statistics on demographics other than students (aged 15-18) as to increase the demographics we are including in our assessments of the overall data.</p>
                <br>
    
                <h4>What will you do to ensure the integrity of your primary and secondary data (i.e reliable and free from bias)?</h4>
                <p>We will only use data from trustworthy sources, such as government websites, educational institutions and heavily peer reviewed and cited sites.</p>
                <br>
    
                <h4>What will you do to ensure the ethical collection, storage and use of collected data?</h4>
                <p>To ensure the ethical collection of data, we will make all of the submissions anonymous which will help with the privacy of the participants and protect their rights (possibly as minors). Furthermore, we will not share any data with third parties and all collected data will be parsed and cleaned of any identifying factors before we release any assessments and graphs to the public. Furthermore, We will obtain consent from all the participants of our survey and make clear our intentions on the use of their information.</p>
