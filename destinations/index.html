                <h1>Common Destinations</h1>

                <p class="info">* The maps below represent a collation of data from our survey. Each country / state will be highlighted with a colour if someone has / wants to visit that country. The darker the country, the greater the number of people that has / wants to travel there.</p>
                <br>

                <h4>Quick Data</h4>
                <p>
                    <span class="focus">55</span> survey participants;<br>
                    On average, they visited <span class="focus">5.59</span> countries<br>
                    In total they traveled to <span class="focus">99</span> unique countries.<br>
                </p>
                <br>
                <div>
                    <h4>Travel habits of different ethnicities</h4>
                    <p>This shows the different travel locations of people of different ethnicity's. The majority of Asian respondents have traveled to Asia, this may be due to family or cultural ties to the continent, while White respondents have traveled to a wider variety of continents. This could be due to traveling for solely tourism rather than other options</p>
                </div>
                <div class="chart" id="continentsVisitedVsEthnicity" style="width: 640px; height: 500px;"></div>

                <div>
                    <h4>Countries that Australians have visited</h4>
                    <p>This graph represents the countries that the respondents of our surveys have visited, a country being a darker shade represents more people having travelled there. The majority of the popular destinations are clustered together, this may be due to people wanting to travel to other nearby countries when they travel somewhere afar, instead of taking multiple longer plane trips, as most people do not enjoy plane trips so will plan their holiday to avoid them.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="chart map" id="map_world" style="width: 640px; height: 600px;"></div>
                <p class="info">* The above graph doesnt fully represent the data we collected as some of the countries, namely Singapore, is not visible due to restrictions with the graphing library.</p>
                <br>

                <div>
                    <h4>States that Australians travel to</h4>
                    <p>This represents the states that Australians have travelled to. All of the respondents of our survey were from Victoria, so none had that as a destination. The most common destination was New south whales, which is likely due to the combination of its popular landmarks and proximity to Victoria, being neighbouring states, this would make sense for why South Australia is also the equal second most visited place, despite not having many important landmarks, compared to the other equal second location, Queensland, which has much more landmarks, such as the great barrier reef and the Daintree rainforest.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="chart map" id="map_au" style="width: 640px; height: 500px;"></div>

                <div>
                    <h4>Where Australians want to travel</h4>
                    <p>This graph shows the destinations respondents picked as the travel destinations that they would like to travel to. This graph is very similar to the destinations that other survey respondents have already travelled to. This is possibly due to people being influenced by their peers to travel to places that their peers have travelled to.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="chart map" id="map_world_want" style="width: 640px; height: 600px;"></div>
                <p class="info">* The above graph sometimes does not display the colours of certain countries, especially in asia and europe, again this is a restriction with the graphing library.</p>
