                <h1>Conclusion</h1>

                <h4>What did the research reveal</h4>
                <p>Our research revealed the various travel habits of the JMSS community. We found the different travel destinations, including the most popular country, Singapore, the most popular continent, Asia, we also learned the enjoyment people have of different travel types, with most people enjoying international travel more than interstate travel</p>

                <br>
                <h4>Did the research reach your groups expectations</h4>
                <p>We expected some of the results, for example people enjoying international travel more than interstate was not surprising, however, other data points surprised us more, for example the total number of countries travelled to.</p>
                <br>
    
                <h4>What did you find surprising</h4>
                <p>We found the variety of different countries that people visited interesting, for example, people visited in total <span class="focus">99</span> total unique countries, which means that the JMSS community has collectively visited <span class="focus">more than 50%</span> of the countries in the world!</p>
